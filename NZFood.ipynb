    "Wellington is the capital city of New Zealand (NZ). Despites its smaller size and population compared to NZ's largest city Auckland (303 km^2 and 607 km^2 respectively [4, 5]), it also has the reputation of being NZ's 'Food Capital'. Even being desribed as the world's best food city [1, 2, 3]. The problem with these artciles is that they are purely subjective. Can consumers, especially tourists that could spend large amounts of money to travel Wellington trust they are getting the best food expereince in New Zealand. I am interested in understanding if the geographical contraints, specifically population density, of Wellington contribute to its 'Food Scence' using Auckland as a comparison? Understanding if cities truely have unqiue food experiences is essential for maintaining the image and repuation of a city for tourism."
